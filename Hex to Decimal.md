<h1>Hexadecimal To Binary Conversion</h1>
<p> The hexadecimal number system is a base 16 system, unlike binary numbers which is base 2. To convert a hexadecimal number we take a hexadecimal symbol, which are <em>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F</em> and use a chart to convert into a four digit binary number. After converting from the chart you conjoin the binary numbers. Below I have attachted a chart for conversion and an example.</p>
