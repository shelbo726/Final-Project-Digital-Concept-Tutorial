<h1>Octal To Binary Conversion</h1>
<p> The Octal number system is a base 8 system, which means there are only 8 symbols in the number system. There are two ways to convert into binary an indirect and direct system. For an indirect conversion you can take an octal number and convert into either decimal or hexadecimal and then convert to binary. The direct verison is similar to hexadecimal and a chart will convert each symbol into a three binary numbers and then conjoin. Below I have attachted examples of indirect and direct conversions. </p>
